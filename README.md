## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a Face Mask Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies images as either "with mask" or "without mask," leveraging real-time video feeds. The system was built using **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **OpenCV**, and it was trained on a dataset from Kaggle. This tool is particularly relevant for ensuring public safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Identify mask compliance in live video feeds.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved with CNN architectures.
- **Easy to Use**: Can be run on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset). It includes images of people with and without face masks.
